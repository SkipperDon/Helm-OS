# d3kOS — Your Boat. Now Smart.

![d3kOS at the helm](assets/lifestyle/helm-monterey.png)

> **"Everything your boat needs — on one clear, reliable screen."**
> **"Upgrade your helm without replacing your electronics."**
> **"Built for real boaters, real conditions, and real confidence."**

d3kOS transforms a Raspberry Pi 4 into a fully intelligent marine helm system.
AI is woven into every part — engine, cameras, weather, navigation, safety, and
your own documents. Preconfigured. Self-installing. Self-healing.

Flash an SD card. Mount a screen. Your boat has a brain.

## This Is Your Boat on AI

![d3kOS Dashboard — Day Mode](assets/screenshots/dashboard-day.png)
*Live engine data, charts, position, AI intelligence — one screen at your helm.*

d3kOS is not a chartplotter app. It is an AI layer that connects every part of
your boat and talks to you in plain English.

**Coolant temperature climbing?** Tap it. d3kOS reads your engine manual, checks
your sensor history, and tells you exactly what is happening and what to do.

**Something in the water ahead?** Forward Watch — your bow camera — scans
continuously and alerts you to objects in your path.

**Heading out tomorrow?** Say "Helm." The voice assistant checks live Windy
satellite weather and gives you a plain-English briefing for your route.

This is what a smart boat looks like.

## Who Is This For?

![Boater using d3kOS at sea](assets/lifestyle/helm-woman-sea.png)

d3kOS is for the boater who:

- Wants more situational awareness without replacing their existing electronics
- Does not have radar, a weather station, or a $5,000 multifunction display
- Is comfortable with basic computer tasks but has never built a Raspberry Pi project
- Wants safety features that keep working even without a cell signal

**If you can burn an SD card, you can run d3kOS.**
The system configures itself. The AI sets itself up. The setup wizard walks you
through the rest in under 15 minutes.

## What Makes d3kOS Different

### AI on Every Instrument
Every reading on your dashboard is live and interactive. Tap any gauge —
coolant temperature, oil pressure, battery voltage — and the AI instantly analyses
it against your sensor history and your own engine manual. Not a generic answer.
Your boat. Your data.

### Your Manuals Live Inside the System
Upload your engine manual, safety checklists, or any PDF. d3kOS indexes every
page into the AI knowledge base. Ask Helm any question and it answers from your
documents — even without internet.

### No Radar Required
- **Forward Watch** — AI-powered bow camera identifies vessels, debris, and navigational markers ahead of you in real time
- **Windy** — satellite wind, wave, and weather data built into the dashboard. Full route weather at a glance, no weather station required.

### Run It on Any Screen
d3kOS is not locked to one display. Run it on:
- A **1000+ nit marine touchscreen** at the helm — readable in direct sunlight
- A **tablet or phone** connected to your boat's WiFi
- Any **HDMI monitor** you already own
- The **AtMyBoat mobile app** — live engine data and alerts from anywhere beyond your marina, on your own phone over cell signal

### Full Raspberry Pi 4 Connectivity
Because d3kOS runs on a Raspberry Pi 4, your helm system has built-in:
- **WiFi** — connect to marina WiFi or broadcast your own boat hotspot for crew
- **Bluetooth** — pair speakers, headsets, or accessories
- **Gigabit Ethernet** — wired connection to your boat network
- **USB 3.0** — cameras, GPS, NMEA gateways, speakerphone
- **HDMI** — any compatible display

Every phone, tablet, or laptop on your boat network can view the dashboard simultaneously.

### Self-Healing System
d3kOS watches itself. Autonomous agents monitor every service, restart what
stops working, and send alerts to your phone before you notice a problem.
If something goes wrong, **Fix My Pi** in the mobile app walks you through
diagnosis and recovery step by step — from anywhere.

### Night Mode. Day Mode. Always Readable.

![d3kOS Night Mode](assets/screenshots/dashboard-night.png)
*Night mode — all gauges readable at the helm in the dark.*

One tap switches between day and night themes. Fonts meet marine display
readability standards — sized for reading from a metre away, in sunlight and in darkness.
